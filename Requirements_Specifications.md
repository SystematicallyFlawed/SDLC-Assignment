## Game Overview

### Brief Description:
Flappy Neon Cat is a reskin of the classic Flappy Bird game, transformed into a neon-themed version featuring a glowing, pixelated cat as the protagonist. The goal is to navigate the cat through a series of neon pipes, tapping the screen to make the cat "flap" and avoid collisions. The game maintains the core mechanics of Flappy Bird but with a colorful, vibrant neon aesthetic.

### Main Goal:
The primary objective is to score as many points as possible by successfully passing through neon pipes. Players must avoid colliding with pipes or the ground. The game ends when the player hits an obstacle, and the score is tracked.
